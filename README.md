## Installation

Use the package manager NPM  to install, and also inside /client as well. 

```bash
npm install
```
And to start the app, Run:

```bash
npm start
```
inside the root directory. 

Ps. I have used Express to serve my React applicatio now, so that the local server will be running at port 8080 for both. 

To seed the database, Run:

```bash
npm run seed
``` 
Ps. I am use MongoDB Atlas to host my backend database. I have exsiting data entries in my database already, so there is no need to seed the database now.
